      <h4>Q.1 What is Database?</h4>
      <p>
        A database is a structured and organized collection of data that is
        stored electronically. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve,
        and manage information. Databases are used in various applications and
        industries to store, organize, and manipulate data for purposes such as
        data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
      </p>

      <h4>Q.2 Types of Databases</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>1. Relational Database :</dt>
        <dd>In this, the data is stored in a table of rows and columns</dd>

        <dt>2. Object Oriented Databases :</dt>
        <dd>In this, the data is stored in form of objects.</dd>

        <dt>3. NoSQL database :</dt>
        <dd>
          It allows to store the data which is unstructured or semistructured.
        </dd>

        <dt>4. Graph database :</dt>
        <dd>
          The data gets stored in the form of entities and the relationship
          between them.
        </dd>

      <h4>Q.5 What is MongoDB?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database
          management system that is designed to store and manage unstructured or
          semi-structured data.
        </li>
        <li>It works on the concept of Collections and documents.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Collections: </b> A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. We
          can have multiple collections in a single database. You can consider
          these collections are like tables that we have in relational databases
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Documents: </b>A document is a set of key-value pairs. These
          documents can have dynamic schema which means that data present in
          same document need not to have the same set of fields or structure
          just because they belong to same collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Value can be any datatype. Some of them are String, Number, Boolean,
          Arrays, Timestamp, Object, Null, Date, Object ID
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Q.6 In what way mongoDb is better than MySQL??</h4>
      <p>
        Compared to MySQL, MongoDB is easier to work with. Since there is no
        need to define schemas.As, MongoDB can store large amounts of
        unstructured data much faster than MySQL. It follows a document-based
        storage approach means MongoDB stores data in a single document for an
        entity and helps in faster data read or write.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Q.7 What kind of databse is mongoDb? or Which format do you use in
        MongoDB?
      </h4>
      <p>mongoDb is a document-oriented NoSQL Database.</p>

      <hr />

      <h4>
        Q.8 What is the command to sort the data in asceding and descending order in mongoDb?</h4>

      <p>Descending Order: db.collectionName.find().sort({ fieldName: -1 }); <br>
        Ascending Order : db.collectionName.find().sort({ fieldName: 1 });
      </p>

      <hr/>

      <h4>Q.9 How to truncate primary key foriegn key in mongoDb?</h4>
      <p>In MongoDB, you don't have the concept of "truncate" for primary keys (referred to as "_id" by default) or foreign keys like you do in traditional relational databases.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>1. Remove All Documents from a Collection:</dt>
        <dd>db.collectionName.deleteMany({});
        </dd>

        <dt>2. Remove Documents Based on a Filter:</dt>
        <dd>db.collectionName.deleteMany({ field: value });</dd>


        <dt>3. Delete the entire collection:</dt>
        <dd>db.collectionName.drop();</dd>
      </dl>



      <h4>Q.10 What is Mongoose ? Why do we use it?</h4>
      <p>Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It simplifies interaction with MongoDB databases by providing a schema-based abstraction.
          <br><br>
          We use it bcz it enables Schema Definiton, provides built-in validation and intregate with Promises and async & await for asynchronous operation.
      </p>


      <h4>Q.11 What is RDBMS?</h4>
      <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It organizes data into row and columns which collectively form a table.</p>
 
      <hr>

      <h4>What is Schema?</h4>
      <p>A schema in the context of databases is a blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized within a database system</p>
